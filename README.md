# IsaacPillTracker

Have you ever been in the middle of a run and you see a pill in the shop or across some spikes or in the shop that you know you've seen in this run, but you can't remember if it was a Health Up or a <insert marginally less useful pill here>? I know I have several times, and it bothered me enough that I've written an app in C# to track what pills in what orientation do what for your current run.

This is an application made for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth which allows you to catalog the pills you have encountered in your current run. This application also has other features such as a transformations sheet, and has plans for a map builder for Curse Of The Lost to be implemented in the future as well as much much more.
This is a passion project of mine and is intended to be 100% open source. I do not own the images I've used in this application and no copyright infringement is intended.
